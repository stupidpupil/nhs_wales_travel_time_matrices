# NHS Wales Travel Time Matrices

This repo contains R code that produces travel time matrices between hospital sites and LSOAs in Wales and bordering areas.

See the [`matrix-releases` branch for the matrices themselves](https://github.com/stupidpupil/nhs_wales_travel_time_matrices/tree/matrix-releases).
